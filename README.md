Image Colorization with GANs and U-Net
This project aims to leverage the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the U-Net architecture to automatically colorize grayscale images, enhancing their visual appeal by generating realistic and vibrant color details. The GAN model is structured to include a generator with a U-Net-like architecture, utilizing skip connections to preserve spatial information, and a discriminator designed to assess the authenticity of the generated images.

Overview
Objective: Colorize grayscale images using a GAN with a U-Net generator.
Methodology: Utilize a conditional GAN setup where the generator takes grayscale images as input and outputs colorized images. The discriminator assesses the authenticity of the generated images by comparing them to real color images.
Architecture: The generator is inspired by the U-Net architecture, incorporating skip connections to facilitate the transfer of high-level semantic information from encoder layers to decoder layers, thus enabling better localization and colorization of details in grayscale images.
Discriminator: Employs a patch discriminator approach, assessing each patch of the generated images separately to capture local changes and subtleties in the colorization process.
