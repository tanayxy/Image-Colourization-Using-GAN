Grayscale Image Colorization with GANs
This repository implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for colorizing grayscale images.

Project Description

GANs are a fascinating branch of machine learning known for their ability to generate realistic and novel data. This project utilizes GANs to tackle the task of colorizing black and white images. The training process is inspired by game theory, where two models – a generator and a discriminator – compete against each other. The generator aims to create realistic colorized images, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and generated images. Through this adversarial training, the generator progressively improves its ability to produce high-quality color outputs.

This project incorporates a custom generator architecture with skip connections, resembling the U-Net model. Skip connections enable the model to preserve spatial information from the input image, leading to more accurate colorization results.

Getting Started

Prerequisites: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including TensorFlow, Keras, and other relevant image processing libraries.
Data Preparation: Prepare your grayscale image dataset for training. This may involve pre-processing steps like resizing and normalization.
Train the Model: Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to train the GAN model. The notebook details the model architecture, training parameters, and visualization tools.
Evaluation: Once training is complete, evaluate the model's performance on unseen grayscale images. Assess the generated colorized outputs for realism and accuracy.
Further Exploration

Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters and network architectures within the Jupyter Notebook. Consider exploring advanced GAN techniques for further improvements in colorization quality.
